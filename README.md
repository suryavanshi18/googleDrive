Overview of the steps involved
MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture is a design pattern that is widely used in software engineering to develop complex software applications. It separates an application into three interconnected components, the Model, View, and Controller, to enhance the maintainability, scalability, and testability of the application.

Model:
First Create an Empty MVC Project. Name of the project: GoogleDriveRestAPI_v3
Opening the NuGet Package Manager Console, Select the package source and install packages
The Model component of the MVC architecture represents the business logic and data of the application. It contains the code that interacts with the database, processes the user input, and manages the application state. In other words, it encapsulates the application's data and logic, such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, validation, and data formatting.

DriveService.Scope.Drive: View and manage the files in your Google Drive.
DriveService.Scope.DriveAppdata: View and manage its own configuration data in your Google Drive.
DriveService.Scope.DriveFile: View and manage google drive files and folders that your are open and created with this app.

DriveService.Scope.DriveMetadata: View and manage metadata of files in your Google Drive
DriveService.Scope.Drive.MetadataReadonly: View metadata of files in your Google Drive.
DriveService.Scope.Drive.PhotosReadonly: views the photos, videos, albums in your Google Photos. 
DriveService.Scope.Drive.ReadOnly: View the files in your Google Drive.
DriveService.Scope.DriveScripts: Modify your Google apps Scripts script behavior.

After this create neccessary repository and class files

View:
The View component of the MVC architecture is responsible for rendering the application's user interface. It is a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that defines the look and feel of the application. The View receives data from the Model and displays it to the user, but it has no knowledge of how the data is stored or processed.

Controller:
The Controller component of the MVC architecture acts as the intermediary between the Model and View. It receives input from the user through the View, and it communicates with the Model to process the input and retrieve data. Once the data is processed, the Controller updates the View with the new data. It also handles user interactions, such as clicks and keystrokes, and initiates actions based on them.

The MVC architecture has the following benefits:

Separation of concerns:
The MVC architecture separates the application's logic, data, and presentation into three distinct components, making it easier to maintain and modify each component without affecting the others.

Reusability:
Each component of the MVC architecture can be reused in other applications, making it easier to develop new applications with similar functionality.

Testability:
The separation of concerns and the modular structure of the MVC architecture make it easier to test each component of the application independently.

Scalability:
The MVC architecture provides a flexible and scalable structure that allows for the easy addition of new features and functionalities to the application without affecting the existing code.




Connecting to Google Cloud APIs requires a few steps:

Create a Google Cloud project and enable the APIs you want to use. Go to the Google Cloud Console, select or create a project, and enable the APIs you want to use under the "APIs & Services" section.

Set up authentication. Google Cloud APIs require authentication to ensure that only authorized users and applications can access the resources. There are several ways to authenticate, such as using a service account or OAuth 2.0 credentials. You can create and manage service accounts and credentials in the "APIs & Services" section of the Google Cloud Console.

Install the necessary client libraries. Google provides client libraries for various programming languages, including JavaScript/Node.js, to make it easier to interact with their APIs. You can install these libraries using package managers like npm for Node.js.

Write code to call the API. Once you have set up authentication and installed the client libraries, you can write code to call the API. The exact code will depend on the API you are using, but typically you will create an instance of the API client using the client library, authenticate with the credentials you set up, and then call the desired API method with any required parameters.


Steps Invloved in the project done using javascript

Set up a Google Cloud Platform project and enable the Google Drive API.
Google Cloud API (Application Programming Interface) refers to the collection of APIs developed by Google that enable developers to interact with various Google Cloud services and resources, including Google Cloud Storage, Google Cloud Machine Learning, Google Cloud Datastore, and many others.

Generate a set of credentials that will allow our app to authenticate with the Google Drive API.

Install the necessary NodeJS packages to access the Google Drive API. The google-auth-library and googleapis packages are required for authentication and API access respectively.

Set up authentication using the generated credentials and obtain an access token.

Use the googleapis package to make API calls to list files and download files from Google Drive.

To list all users who have access to a file, use the permissions.list method of the Google Drive API.

To receive real-time updates when users are added or removed from a file, use the Google Drive API's Push Notifications feature.
